 Blinking LED

  Turns an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.

  Most Arduinos have an on-board LED you can control. On the UNO, MEGA and ZERO
  it is attached to digital pin 13, on MKR1000 on pin 6. LED_BUILTIN is set to
  the correct LED pin independent of which board is used.
/*



// Define the LED pin
const int LED_BUILTIN = 13;

// Setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  // Initialize the digital pin as an output.
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

// Loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH); // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);                // Wait for 1 second
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);  // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);                // Wait for 1 second
}
